Trying to get a basic working web app which turns an output on and off 
(for instance to switch a solenoid ) , keeps a count , updates a web page with count and
give a basic interface for stopping / starting test.

At this point has basic functionality to turn on and off output. Next steps is to add 
mechanism to cycle and update count to webpage ( websocket probably, maybe ajax ) as well
as web interface.
